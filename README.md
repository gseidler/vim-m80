# vim-m80

This is a simple plugin to highlight 8080 and Z80 assembly code based on Microsoft's MACRO-80 assembler documentation. It still has no advanced preprocessor highlighting rules but is should already do the basics like opcodes and directives keyword highlighting as well as numbers, strings and comments.

## Install
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):
* ```Plugin 'oraculo666/vim-m80'```
